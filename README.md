# Paguroidea

A reimplementation of the Flap parser in Rust (with our own modifications applied)!

## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§
This project is still under its early-stage development. The grammar for Paguroidea is subject to change 
(see [Issue #22](https://github.com/SchrodingerZhu/paguroidea/issues/22)). The parser generation is not thoroughly tested,
which may still shake some bugs out from time to time.
